All of the editable source files for css and js are in `src`. To bundle for prod, run the following commands:

#### CSS

```

#### JS

Assuming [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is installed globally:

##### Single build:

npm run build
```


##### Applied Coding practices / ESLint Rules:
- _indent_: use __tab (2 space tab)__ instead of spaces to not get an error.
- _linebreak-style_: use __\n__ for a newline, if you're on windows, configure it in your editor settings.
- _quotes_: use __single quote__ instead of double quote.
- _semi_: use _semi colon_ at end of each statement / expression / function definition.
- _comma-dangle_: do not use dangling commas i.e. extra comma at the end of object values, function args, etc.). More about this [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle).
- More pre-configured rules from __eslint:recommended__ you must follow to not get errors [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

##### Developing:
To serve your code at [localhost:3456](http://localhost:3456) and rebuild it every time it changes, run:
